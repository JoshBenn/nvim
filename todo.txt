==Incomplete:
Neotree
- Interferes with buffer closing -- if I close a buffer it will automatically close the entire session if it's open

Dashboard:
- Adjust its position

Comment:
- Fix the keybinding issue (still uses gcc and gc instead of <leader>....)

Debug:
- Actually implement / fix it

Multicursor:
- Pair completion for delimiters doesn't work well
- Make it so lines can be skipped
